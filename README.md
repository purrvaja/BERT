# Unveiling AI Trends: Topic Modeling with BERT

### Project Overview

This project delves into the evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI) research by analyzing a collection of recent academic papers. The power of the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model has been leveraged to perform unsupervised topic modeling on a diverse collection of AI research papers.

### Objectives

-   Utilize BERT to extract meaningful topics from a corpus of AI research papers.
-  Generate interpretable representations of the identified topics.
-   Gain insights into the current direction and potential future of AI development.

### Key Topics Found: 

 - Bayesian 
 - Reinforcement Learning
 - Neural Networks
 - Speech Recognition
 - Clustering
